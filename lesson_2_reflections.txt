What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository a new directory is created, .git. This directory will store all the commits of the
files which will be tracked using git system. It is necesary to initialize a repository, because otherwise the git
system won't track any changes in the directory containing any files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate area where the files added to this area can be commited to the repository once the
changes are complete. The value of this approach is that the commits will be more logical and will contain only files
which contains changes to the code.
