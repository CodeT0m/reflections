When would you want to create a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local?
The remote repository is useful when you want to share your work with others or for collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?
When you work in a team on a remote repository you may want to pull a branch manually after you check the code before
adding the latest commits. This way you can avoid errors made in the new commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are used to copy a repository from a Github account to another. The original repository won't allow to push
modifications without permission, so you can use a forked repository to add changes. Clones are copies of repositories
from Github to local computer. When you work on a project you can clone a repository, work on a local computer and then
push the local repository to Github. Branches are different paths of commits of the same repository. Branches are used
when work is done by collaborating, or when a new feature is added but is not commited to the master branch.
