When would you want to create a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local?
The remote repository is useful when you want to share your work with others or for collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?
When you work in a team on a remote repository you may want to pull a branch manually after you check the code before
adding the latest commits. This way you can avoid errors made in the new commits.
